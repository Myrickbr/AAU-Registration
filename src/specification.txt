Project 2

SPECIFICATION
  
OVERVIEW

A Program to manage registrations for a local youth soccer association.
The program allows users to add and delete players, edit a player's 
information, print lists of players, and search for players using a 
variety of criteria.


DETAILS

The program has two views. First, the browsing view allows the user to
browse through a list of all players. On the other hand, the search results
view allows the user to browse through players produced by a search. In
both views, players are shown one line at a time in alphabetical order
(by last name then first name). Two commands "next" and "previous" allows
the user to view other players.

The program always displays the rank of the player and the total number of
players in the current view. For example, when viewing the 10th player after
a search that returns 15 players, the program will display "10 out of 15".

Also, for each player the program records the player's name, year of birth,
category, and registration status. The possible categories are U6, U8, U10, 
U12, U14 and U17. The registration status is either "paid" or "not paid".
