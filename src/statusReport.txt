STATUS REPORT

The browsing view of the program works essentially as expected. There are a couple 
minor issues with the browsing view, one of which is when editing/deleting the 
file doesn't save correctly. It appears correctly when not closing the program,
however once you close the program it adds an extra player. Also, we run the 
program under the assumption that the year is always 2018, so categories are 
calculated based upon the year 2018.

The search view doesn't have the ability to modify the players, only search and scroll.
The reason for this is because we created a separate map that contains search results and 
the edit and add methods only edit and add to the m_entries_ map, not the search_results
map. Also, since print a list asks the user for a name of a file, it is not exactly the same
as listed in the project description. However, we do write to the file Registrations.txt after
every edit or addition.
